Ableton Live 9.1.4 Remote Scripts
=============================

## Script-Editor's Edition ##
14/10/29:

This repo has been modified to make editing these control scripts a little easier.  For one, you can clone it directly into the "MIDI Remote Scripts" folder of your Live install and be able to edit the decompiled scripts alongside the original files without deleting or moving anything.  All the native script directories are ignored.  I appended "-dcmp" to all the directories in this repo to indicate that the scripts it contains are decompiled.

My ultimate ambition with this is to fix the decompilation errors that occurred in the major control scripts.  Most scripts contain at least some errors from the decompilation process that need to be fixed in order to function properly.
